# EthPanel

A friendly web interface to my ethereum node.

## Running

You must have [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) installed on your computer.
From the root project directory run these commands from the command line:

    npm install

This will install all dependencies.

To build the project, first run this command:

    npm start

This will perform an initial build and start a watcher process that will update bundle.js with any changes you wish to make.

To run the app, spin up an HTTP server and visit index.html, or simply open the index.html file in a browser.
